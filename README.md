The Restaurant Management System is software that helps run a restaurant smoothly. It allows customers to place orders, chefs to prepare food, and waiters to serve it. The system also handles payments, keeps track of inventory, and provides reports to the manager. It makes work easier and faster for everyone.Customers can place orders, pay bills, and give feedback through the system.
Waiters use the system to take and confirm orders, and then serve the food once it's prepared.
Chefs receive the orders and prepare the food, updating the system when the food is ready.
Managers can track inventory, check reports on sales, and manage staff.
This system helps the restaurant run more efficiently by reducing mistakes, speeding up service, and improving communication between staff members. It also helps manage stock and monitor business performance through reports.
